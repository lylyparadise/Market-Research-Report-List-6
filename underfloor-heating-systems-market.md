<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Underfloor Heating Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gas Heating</li><li>Electric Heating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Underfloor heating systems come primarily in two types: gas heating and electric heating. Gas heating systems utilize a network of pipes filled with warm water, which is heated by a boiler powered by natural gas. This type is often favored for larger areas due to its efficiency in heat distribution. Electric heating systems, on the other hand, use electric cables or mats installed beneath the floor to generate heat directly. They are easier to install and work well in smaller spaces or renovations.</p></p>
