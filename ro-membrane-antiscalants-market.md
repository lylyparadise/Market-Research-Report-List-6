<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The RO Membrane Antiscalants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Acid Antiscalants</li><li>Alkaline Antiscalants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The RO membrane antiscalants market is primarily divided into two types: acid antiscalants and alkaline antiscalants. Acid antiscalants are typically used to prevent inorganic scale formation by modifying the solubility of minerals, making them less likely to precipitate on RO membranes. In contrast, alkaline antiscalants help in controlling scaling by altering the pH levels, which impacts the solubility of calcium and other scale-forming compounds. Both types are essential for enhancing the efficiency and longevity of reverse osmosis systems.</p></p>
