<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Coal-fired Power Generation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pulverized Coal System</li><li>Cyclone Furnaces</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Coal-fired power generation encompasses various technologies, primarily categorized into two market types: pulverized coal systems and cyclone furnaces. Pulverized coal systems involve finely grinding coal and burning it in a boiler, providing efficient heat transfer and energy output. In contrast, cyclone furnaces utilize a cyclone burner design, allowing for a broader range of coal particles, including lower-grade fuels, to be combusted effectively. Both systems play critical roles in meeting energy demands while addressing efficiency and emissions challenges.</p></p>
