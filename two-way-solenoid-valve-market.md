<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Two-Way Solenoid Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct-acting Type</li><li>Sub-step Direct-acting Type</li><li>Pilot-type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The two-way solenoid valve market comprises three main types: Direct-acting, Sub-step Direct-acting, and Pilot-type. Direct-acting types operate directly when voltage is applied, suitable for low-flow applications. Sub-step Direct-acting valves provide precise control by modulating flow incrementally, enhancing efficiency in complex systems. Pilot-type valves use a smaller solenoid to control a larger flow, ideal for high-pressure applications, offering greater flexibility and reduced energy consumption. Each type serves varied needs across process automation and fluid control industries.</p></p>
